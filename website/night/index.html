			<h3>Peekers</h3>
			<large>Peekers are a very trendy and attractive style of sticker design that many people today are very fond of. The main idea behind peekers is that only the eyes or sometimes the mouths are shown without anything else, like the name suggested. You can only see the most of the face and many people are going crazy over this. <a href="peekers.html">View Gallery</a>

			<h3>Decals</h3>
			<large>Decals are a special kind of stickers. They are your usual slap on full art kind of stickers. They are more like design stickers that can include just fonts or texts to advertise, or a simple piece of art to slap on, but nothing too heavy in the colors. This is an example of a simple decal sticker. <a href="decals.html">View Gallery</a>
